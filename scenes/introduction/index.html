        You are a kobold. You are small, flexible, nimble and rather stealthy when you want to be. On the other hand you are na&iuml;ve, not very strong, kind of a 
        pushover and generally not very good in a fight.

    <div class="koboldadventuretext">
        The world is mostly predominated with humans, who see you as a lesser species. Kobolds officially have no rights, so the sight of one of your kind getting raped, 
        beaten or even killed in broad daylight is unfortunately for you not so uncommon.

        Luckily, you have managed to avoid the worst, by making your home in the outstretched woods surrounding the human capital of <span class="bold">Varanar</span>.
        Many beasts lurk here, including dragons and feral animals of all kinds. There are even some rumors of a hulking mass of tentacles skulking through the darkness, 
        violating whatever it gets in its grip.
    </div>
    
    <div class="koboldadventuretext">
        On top of the feral dangers, there are various bands of bandits which have made these woods their home. They pry on unsuspecting victims, to rob them from their 
        riches, their decency, their life or all three.
