                You are a kobold. You are small, flexible, nimble and rather stealthy when you want
                to be. On the other hand you are na&iuml;ve, not very strong, kind of a pushover and 
                generally not very good in a fight.
            </div>

            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                The world is mostly predominated with humans, who see you as a lesser species. 
                Kobolds officially have no rights, so the sight of one of your kind getting raped, 
                beaten or even killed in broad daylight is unfortunately for you not so uncommon.
            </div>

            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Luckily, you have managed to avoid the worst, by making your home in the outstretched 
                woods surrounding the human capital of <span class="bold">Varanar</span>.
                Many beasts lurk here, including dragons and feral animals of all kinds. 
                There are even some rumors of a hulking mass of tentacles skulking through the darkness, 
                violating whatever it gets in its grip.
            </div>

            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                On top of the feral dangers, there are various bands of bandits which have made these woods 
                their home. They prey on unsuspecting victims, to rob them of their 
                riches, their decency, their life or all three.

                You are male. You're a bit stronger than the females of your kind, 
                yet still pathetically weak compared to anything that isn't a kobold. 
                Since you lack brawn, you've relied on your sharp wits and your tiny frame 
                to pick your fights wisely and to avoid unnecessary conflict by hiding in the 
                shadows. This has worked out pretty well thus far. You've managed to avoid most 
                of the human bigotry commonly hurled towards your kind. An impressive feat, 
                considering you grew up in the human capital of Varanar, the heart of 
                their xenophobic empire.

                You’re wearing nothing but a small, simple loincloth, which covers the cockslit 
                between your legs and your virginal tailhole quite nicely. While usually not 
                having any breasts to speak of, females of your kind typically tend to cover 
                up their chests. You, however, proudly display yours as a sign of masculinity. 
                Humans don’t seem to like that a lot, yet who cares what they think?

                You are female. You’re not quite as strong as the males of your kind, but you make 
                up for it by being even lighter, even more nimble and just a little bit more flexible. 
                Enemies you face might be more concerned with fucking something as small and cute as 
                yourself rather than trying to hurt you. This may be a good thing, yet if you don’t 
                watch out you might end up a cum-filled lizard before long.

                Thanks to your isolation, you have managed to avoid abuse thus far. As a result, you 
                are still a virgin. You have never had sex, and you hope things will stay this way 
                unless you finally find the kobold of your dreams.
