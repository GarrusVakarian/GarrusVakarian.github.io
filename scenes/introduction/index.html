            You are a kobold. You are small, flexible, nimble and rather stealthy when you want to be. On the other hand you are na&iuml;ve, not very strong, kind of a 
            pushover and generally not very good in a fight.
        </div>

        <div class="koboldadventuretext">
            The world is mostly predominated with humans, who see you as a lesser species. Kobolds officially have no rights, so the sight of one of your kind getting raped, 
            beaten or even killed in broad daylight is unfortunately for you not so uncommon.
        </div>

        <div class="koboldadventuretext">
            Luckily, you have managed to avoid the worst, by making your home in the outstretched woods surrounding the human capital of <span class="bold">Varanar</span>.
            Many beasts lurk here, including dragons and feral animals of all kinds. There are even some rumors of a hulking mass of tentacles skulking through the darkness, 
            violating whatever it gets in its grip.
        </div>

        <div class="koboldadventuretext">
            On top of the feral dangers, there are various bands of bandits which have made these woods their home. They pry on unsuspecting victims, to rob them of their 
            riches, their decency, their life or all three.

                You are male. You're a bit stronger than the females of your kind, yet still pathetically weak compared to anything that isn't a kobold. Since you lack brawn, you've relied on your sharp wits and your tiny frame to pick your fights wisely and to avoid unnecessary conflict by hiding in the shadows. This has worked out pretty well thus far. You've managed to avoid most of the human bigotry commonly hurled towards your kind. An impressive feat, considering grew up in the human capital of Varanar, the heart of their xenophobic empire.

            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                You’re wearing nothing but a small, simple loincloth, which covers the cockslit between your legs and your virginal tailhole quite nicely. While usually not having any breasts to speak of, females of your kind typically tend to cover up their chests. You, however, proudly display yours as a sign of masculinity. Humans don’t seem to like that a lot, yet who cares what they think?

                You are female. You’re not quite as strong as the males of your kind, but you make up for it by being even lighter, even more nimble and just a little bit more flexible. Enemies you face might be more concerned with fucking something as small and cute as yourself rather than trying to hurt you. This may be a good thing, yet if you don’t watch out you might end up a cum-filled lizard before long.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Thanks to your isolation, you have managed to avoid abuse thus far. As a result, you are still a virgin. You have never had sex, and you hope things will stay this way unless you finally find the kobold of your dreams.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                You are wearing a small chest wrap which covers up your rather flat bosom quite nicely. Down below, a simple loincloth provides you with some decency. The piece of clothing has seen better days, and your rather active lifestyle has left it somewhat ragged. 
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                You are returning from a trip to Varanar, where you sold some trinkets you found on an old, abandoned graveyard. Sadly enough, you only managed to earn enough coins to pay for a single meal. It was some of the tastiest bunny you’ve ever eaten, but it wasn’t worth three whole days of scavenging.

                As you are walking down the dirt road back towards your small shack in the woods, you come across a band of humans making camp for the night along the side of the road. You are wary of them, as you are of all humans. You hide in the bushes to spy on them for a moment. There seem to be four men and a woman in this particular group. They also seem to have a pet, a dog to be more precise, which is currently sleeping next to the small campfire they have set up. 
            </div>
            You decide to take a detour throughout the woods to circumvent the humans. Just as you are about to step off the beaten path, a loud roar catches your attention. The humans have heard it as well. Two of them draw swords. One readies a spear. The dog awakens, and starts barking loudly. “Let’s go catch us some dinner, boys!” one of the men shouts. On his command, all four of the men, as well as the dog, charge into the woods. The woman rolls her eyes, and retreats into her tent.
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                The camp is now unattended. You might be able to steal a few things from it, if you’re quick enough. Or you could pay the lone woman a visit, and hope she won’t bash your brains in with a rock.
