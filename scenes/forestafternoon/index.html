                As you are walking down the dirt road back towards your small shack in the woods,
                you come across a band of humans making camp for the evening along the side of the road.
                You are wary of them, as you are of all humans. You hide in some nearby bushes to spy on them
                for a moment. There seem to be three men and a woman in this particular group. They
                also have a pet, a dog to be more precise, which is currently sleeping next
                to the small unlit campfire they have set up.

                    You decide to stay concealed in the bush, observing the humans for a bit. You assume the woman is a travelling
                    merchant, based on how well she is dressed and the sheer size of the hefty bag of coins she carries 
                    around her neck. The men appear to be her bodyguards. They are heavily armed. 
                    You wonder where they store their goods. Are they even carrying any?
                </div>
                <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                    The group finishes setting up their camp. The guards' three small, weathered tents contrast dearly 
                    with the merchant's extravagantly large one, which looks as though it was hand woven from silk. 
                    Or velvet. You can't really tell the difference. It looks fancy as hell, though.
                </div>
                <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                    "All done, my lady." one of the men reports to the woman with a small, courteous bow. She acknowledges
                    his work with only the slightest of nods. Speaking so softly you can barely hear her, the merchant replies:
                    "Very good. Get the fire going. I will be resting in my tent until morning comes. I do not wish to be disturbed."
                </div>
                <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                    Not bothering to wait for a response, the lady daintily turns around, stepping into her tent. The beautifully 
                    colored flaps fall shut ever so gracefully behind her. You're starting to get the feeling that you're dealing
                    with more than just a simple travelling merchant.

                <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                    As the woman disappears into her tent, the man sighs deeply and audibly. He wipes his brow, and proceeds towards
                    the campfire. Leaning down, he wakes up their sleeping pet by rubbing its head in a very endearing way. 
                    "Get up, old pal. Don't want your tail to catch on fire...<span class="italic">again</span>."

                <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                    The lazy, aging dog relishes the feeling of its master's warm palm against its head, grinding back against it 
                    affectionately. After a moment, it finally gets to its feet, scurrying just a few feet away from the stack of
                    tinder and dried wood.

                <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                    As the man begins to strike sparks in order to light the fire, you notice the dog's nose begin to twitch. 
                    The golden-coated German Shepherd lowers its head to the ground, sniffing intently. It seems to have caught 
                    the scent of something. It slowly begins to wander away from the camp. <span class="bold">Directly towards you.</span>

                    You decide to take a detour throughout the woods to circumvent the party. Just as you are 
                    about to step off the beaten path, a loud roar catches your attention. The humans have heard 
                    it as well. Two of them draw swords. One readies a spear. The dog awakens, and starts barking 
                    loudly. The armed men exchange glances, a single solemn nod from each of them signaling their 
                    readiness.  command, all three of the men, as well as the dog, charge into the woods. 
                    The woman rolls her eyes, and retreats into her tent.

                    The camp is now unattended. You might be able to steal a few things from it, if you’re quick enough. 
                    Or you could pay the lone woman a visit, and hope she won’t bash your brains in with a rock.
