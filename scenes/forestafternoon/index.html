                As you are walking down the dirt road back towards your small shack in the woods,
                you come across a band of humans making camp for the evening along the side of the road.
                You are wary of them, as you are of all humans. You hide in some nearby bushes to spy on them
                for a moment. There seem to be three men and a woman in this particular group. They
                also have a pet, a dog to be more precise, which is currently sleeping next
                to the small unlit campfire they have set up.

            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                You decide to stay concealed in the bush, observing the humans for a bit. You assume the woman is a travelling
                merchant, based on how well she is dressed and the sheer size of the hefty bag of coins she carries 
                around her neck. The men appear to be her bodyguards. They are heavily armed. 
                You wonder where they store their goods. Are they even carrying any?
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                The group finishes setting up their camp. The guards' three small, weathered tents contrast dearly 
                with the merchant's extravagantly large one, which looks as though it was hand woven from silk. 
                Or velvet. You can't really tell the difference. It looks fancy as hell, though.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                "All done, my lady." one of the men reports to the woman with a small, courteous bow. She acknowledges
                his work with only the slightest of nods. Speaking so softly you can barely hear her, the merchant replies:
                "Very good. Get the fire going. I will be resting in my tent until morning comes. I do not wish to be disturbed."
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Not bothering to wait for a response, the lady daintily turns around, stepping into her tent. The beautifully 
                colored flaps fall shut ever so gracefully behind her. You're starting to get the feeling that you're dealing
                with more than just a simple travelling merchant.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                As the woman disappears into her tent, the man sighs deeply and audibly. He wipes his brow, and proceeds towards
                the campfire. Leaning down, he wakes up their sleeping pet by rubbing its head in a very endearing way. 
                "Get up, old pal. Don't want your tail to catch on fire...<span class="italic">again</span>." 
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                The lazy, aging dog relishes the feeling of its master's warm palm against its head, grinding back against it 
                affectionately. After a moment, it finally gets to its feet, scurrying just a few feet away from the stack of
                tinder and dried wood.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                As the man begins to strike sparks in order to light the fire, you notice the dog's nose begin to twitch. 
                The golden-coated German Shepherd lowers its head to the ground, sniffing intently. It seems to have caught 
                the scent of something. It slowly begins to wander away from the camp. <span class="bold">Directly towards you.</span>

                You remain perfectly still. The dog continues to approach you, clearly having picked up your scent. If it barks,
                the entire camp will be alerted to your presence. Who knows what a bunch of bloodthirsty humans armed to the teeth 
                would do to a poor little kobold like yourself?!
            </div> 
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Worse yet, the dog could be aggressive. It might attack you! While old, the beast still looks like far more than you 
                could handle in a fight. It's nearly your own size, and going off of the amount of scars on its face, it's been in 
                more than one scrap before.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                As more and more grim scenarios flood your head, you freeze up in fear. The German Shepherd closes the remainder of the 
                distance between you and it. It is standing right in front of you. You cover your mouth with both your hands, muffling 
                a small, fearful shriek. The beast is staring straight at you through the concealing foliage. Its head slowly moves closer, 
                fangs bared.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Tears roll down your cheeks. You are scared shitless. You squeeze your eyes shut, awaiting the inevitable. You can feel the
                dog's warm breath on your cold, scaly neck. You almost wet yourself as a loud sniff pierces the uncomfortable silence, quickly
                followed by another. Slowly opening your eyes, you are greeted with the sight of the dog sitting in front of you, its tongue lolling
                out of its mouth. You feel incredibly relieved. You uncover your mouth, and let out a soft relieved sigh. You almost had a heart attack!
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Before you have time to fully gather your wits, the canine gives your face a broad, wet lick. It has a really, <span class="italic">really</span>

                You stay perfectly still, hoping the dog will just go away out of boredom. You heard somewhere that dogs 
                can't see things that are stationary, but you're not sure how credible your source was. Humans tend to lie 
                about these kinds of things just so they can have a good laugh when a kobold like yourself gets into trouble 
                for being so gullible. 
            </div> 
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                The beast continues to sit in front of you. It is panting softly. Its head is tilted quizzically. The canine
                gives your face a few more licks, letting out a sad whine as you flat out ignore it, not even moving to
                wipe its spit from your scales.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                The dog's master seems to have noticed his pet's disappearance. Looking over the canine's head, you can see 
                the human approaching from the camp. "Rex! Get your scrawny tail back over here, boy. Got a nice succulent bone
                from yesterday's hunt with your name on it!"
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Excitedly, the animal rises from its seated position. You think it's about to leave, yet it stops halfway
                through turning around, presenting its side towards you. You briefly wonder if it heard or smelled something 
                over that way, yet its next move quickly dismisses that thought. The dog slowly lifts one of its hind legs,
                just like it's about to...<span class="italic">oh no</span>. <span class="italic">Please don't</span>...
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Before you can even cover your face, an acrid stream of yellow dog piss squirts from the German Shepherd's
                sheath, hitting you straight in the face. You close your eyes and turn your head to the side, yet it's not of 
                much use. You're not sure whether the human is still there, but you're too scared you'll get caught to move away.
                You swallow your pride, grit your teeth and decide to endure the disgusting ordeal until Rex' bladder has emptied.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                The powerful spray of steaming liquid occasionally hits a leaf of the bush you're hiding in, splattering all over your body,
                reaching places that the regular flow never would have. While the sheer humiliation and the warm, wet flow are enough to make
                your stomach turn, it is the horrible stench that is getting to you the most. 
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                You don't want to get any of the piss in your mouth, yet every breath you take through your nose makes you want to throw up more and more. 
                You resort to trying to hold your breath, yet you're not sure you can hold it for long enough. The thought of the scent lingering, of it 
                seeping into your scales and staying with you for weeks, terrifies you even more than the heavily armed band humans.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Finally, the the stream begins to fade into a trickle, the dog lowering its leg as the final few droplets fall to the mossy ground 
                below. As soon as you become aware the ordeal is over, you instantly wipe your face with your hands, trying to get as much of the wetness off 
                as you can. You manage to clean your face a bit, yet in your scarred, traumatized mind it just seems as though you're rubbing it into your scales. 
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Your lips are trembling. Tears have formed at the corners of your eyes, and they are starting to spill out, rolling over your cheeks before 
                dripping down to the ground, almost indistinguishable from the other fluid dripping from your face. Your entire body is soaked in rapidly cooling, 
                horribly smelling dog piss. You are mentally drained.
            </div>
            <div class="koboldadventuretext">
                Wiping your eyes of urine and tears, you notice both the canine and the human walking back to their camp, side by side. You don't hesitate to get 
                out of the wet bush. You don't really care about the camp any more.

                Feeling just a little bit better about yourself, you decide to take a small walk in the woods before night falls, pondering the events that have transpired thus far.
                You're glad you stuck around the human camp for just a little bit. The encounter with the dog was just the pick-me-up you needed after
                the disappointing scavenging haul.
